# Frontend Challenge — Day One  

Today, I started my **Frontend Challenge** — to build multiple web apps using **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks, no libraries)!  
My goal is to sharpen my fundamentals and create functional, beautiful UIs from scratch.

💡 This challenge helped me truly understand the **concept of the DOM** — something I once thought was complex but turned out to be incredibly easy once I explored it hands-on.  

🔥 I no longer struggle with DOM manipulation, and this project gave me the confidence to dive deeper into interactive web experiences.
